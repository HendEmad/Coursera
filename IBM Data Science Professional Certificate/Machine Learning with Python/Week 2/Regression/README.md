Dependent variables can be seen as: State, Target, Final goal we study and try to predict (X)

Independent variables can be seen as: explanatory variables, the causes of the states (Y)

The regression model relates Y ot dependent variable to a function of X.

The key point is that the `dependent value` should be `continous`. However, the indpependent variables can be measured or either a categorical or continuous measurement scale.

## Types of regression models:
1. Simple regression : when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable. It can be linear or non-linear. 
2. Multiple linear regression: When more than one independent variable is present.

**note**: Linearity of the regression is based on the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
